        LEAGUE OF THE STARS (also known as the LOTS Cup) is
        an annual club football competition organised by the 4
        My Own Football Association (MOFA) and contested by
        top-division clubs from all over the world, deciding the competition winners.
        It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments
        in the world and the most prestigious club competition
        in World football, played by the national league champions
        (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their
        national associations.

        Introduced in 1985 as the Stars of the World Cup (SOWC),
        it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the
        champion club of each national championship. The competition took
        on its current name in 2010, adding a round-robin group stage and
        allowing multiple entrants from certain countries. It has since
        been expanded, and while most of World's national leagues can still
        only enter their champion, the strongest leagues now provide up to four
        teams. Clubs that finish next-in-line in their national league,
        having not qualified for the LOTS, are eligible for the second-tier
        SOWC League-1, and from 2025, teams not eligible for the
        SOWC League Of Glory (SOWCLOG) will qualify for a
        new third-tier competition called
        the SOWC Masters (SOWCM).

  <h4>History</h4>
  <p>The first pan-World tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition
    between club in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
    The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup,
    was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl,
    and played between Central European clubs.</p>
  <p>In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup),
    the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe,
    was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.
    Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent.
    The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.
    Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.</p>
